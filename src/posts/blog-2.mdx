Hiking is a great way to get outside, stay active, and explore the natural world. If you're new to hiking, it can be a little intimidating at first. But with a little planning and preparation, it's a fun and rewarding activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and fitness levels.

To get started, choose a trail that's appropriate for your skill level and pack plenty of water and snacks. Dress in layers so you can adjust to changing temperatures, and wear comfortable shoes with good traction. As you hike, take the time to enjoy the scenery and appreciate the beauty of nature.
